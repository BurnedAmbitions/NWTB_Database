#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Now will you take me along
When you fly away, and play your song?
Cause seven years is far too long
I know she knows she gives me everything
Gives me courage, gives me wisdom, gives me strength
For her, I only hope I'll do the same

**Chorus**
Now, I won't ever be the same
Ever since I've learned this princess' name
Now, it seems there's just no other way
I'll win her heart by the dawn of the third day

**Verse 2**
When I'm high and dry, she's my Song of Storms
When I'm cold at night, her Din's fire keeps me warm
I could feel her since the day that I was born
When I'm bloodied, battered, beaten from the longest fights
She hookshots straight to my heart and holds me tight
We'll stay up late and share our stories all night
```
