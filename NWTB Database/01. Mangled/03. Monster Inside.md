#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Now I'm scared to even open my mouth
Because there's something deep inside of me
You don't know about
And I wish there was a way you could see
If I could show maybe I'd know
If I'm a man or a beast

**Chorus**
Just take one look in my eyes
You'd see right through my disguise
She says that when I'm nearby
That she can feel my every move
When I fell apart
Yeah, something changed in my heart
As you can tell from these scars
I'm not the man that you knew before
I found something that makes me feel alive yet somehow dead inside
It makes me feel
It makes me numb at once
It makes no sense
Yet it still helps me see
So am I soon to be the monster that I despise?

**Verse 2**
She thinks she's mine
She must be out of her mind
I said, "Get back", but she wants more
And now her body's o-on the floor
I've got this thing in my heart
I have to hide
It's eating at me from the inside

**Bridge**
(Monster that I despise)
(Monster that I despise)
(Monster that I despise)
It's eating at me from the inside
```

### Other Notes
Nate's feelings about Monster Inside, from Genius Lyrics, sourced from a now private video:
- I have too many good memories associated with this song, it was one of the first, if not the first song me and Shawn ever worked on together, which was the beginning of an absolutely life-changing career move ... I cannot thank Shawn enough, this was also a song that I carried around with me for a little while, this is one of the songs where I was showing friends who liked Parasyte, like: “Yo, check this out”, and they’re like: “Yo, that’s so sick because I understand the nuances and the little clever little lyrical stuff”, it has a very special place in my heart, so purely from a song standpoint, ... I’m still very proud of Monster Inside, I still love it just sonically, but then everything, every thought I have attached to it means a lot to me.
