#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
I first saw you at Cerulean Gym
Just out a rocky tunnel
It was the way you'd laugh
And the way that you swim
I knew that you'd be trouble
We made such a big splash, big crash
You'll be my tidal wave
Breaks me down like an avalanche
Then we go dance in the rain

**Chorus**
Misty, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
I'm gone forever
Don't tease me, my heart is freezing
Since you whipped up this icy weather
I'm talking in my sleep
This story won't star me
And you feel sheer cold to me
But Misty, you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone, gone forever
And I'll never recover

**Verse 2**
Now I knew that my chances were slim
That much is plain to see
But I found you standing with him
And thought, "It should have been me!"
I had my chance and I blew it
My frozen heart saw right through it
I'm coming down like a crashing wake

**Bridge**
From the burn from when you scald my heart
Chewed me up, fangs of ice
And then you ripped me apart
Thunder wave, I can't move
I'm paralyzed around you
I got hax'd and confused from the start
(Again? Great)

**Outro**
Gone, gone forever
And I'll never recover
Now I'm gone, gone forever
And I'll never recover
Gone, gone forever
And I'll never recover
```
