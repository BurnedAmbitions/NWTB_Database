#### Lyrics
**Intro**
It's been years
Since I've seen a face 'round here
I was broken and alone
In that hell I called my home
You always choose to stay
Spend your nights keeping me away
You think you stand a chance to last
Against the ghosts of your past?

**Verse 1**
It's been years
Since I've seen a face 'round here
I was broken and alone
In that Hell I called my home
Should've left me to decay
Finding me was your worst mistake
And I've found my new obsession
Now it's just you and me

**Chorus**
You turn away, I'll be right beside you
You cut me off but I'll always have another way to find you
My body's still mending, you're in for a sight
Another night but it doesn't get easy
Because you're stuck picking up all the pieces
That they salvaged
No matter what the ending, you won't last the night

**Verse 2**
I hear you breathing in your room
Now don't you panic, it'll all be over soon
And you can play your little games all day
You'll never be free
You block me out all you want
But I hear the sound
The echo of a "hello"
I'll come back around

**Bridge**
No happy ending will ever find you
All of these ghosts, they're from deep inside you
No happy ending will ever find you (No happy endings will find you)
All of these ghosts, they're from deep inside you (And all of these ghosts are from deep inside you)
```
