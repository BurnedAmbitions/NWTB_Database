#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
I've done my best to look inside
But I found nothing, no shame, no pride
I need something to hang on to
I miss when you were here by my side
They dress you up to fit the part
Believe that you don't have the heart
Now I've grown so sick of running
To find I'm only at the start
(I'm at the start)

**Chorus**
They can call us heartless
Hollow vessels of what we used to be
Don't you forget about me
Now commit this to your memories
They say that we're nobodies
Only shadows we're meant to fade
But I can't believe that it's true
You're a memory I can't lose
I'll hold on to you

**Post-Chorus**
Remember, please remember
Remember who I used to be
Who am I? Who am I?
I can't find my way to reality-y-y
Oh!
Got it memorized?

**Verse 2**
My heart's a battlefield
And there's a war waging
A storm is raging on
But I won't forgive myself
If I fade away, gone and forgotten
If you disappear, then would you fear
That no one would miss you?
Well you're wrong 'cause I'm not
Letting go of the days we shared

```
