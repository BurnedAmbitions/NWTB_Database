#### Lyrics
**Verse 1: AmaLee**
You will go far away
You will do great things, be our saving grace
But only...
Travel off, you will find
Room to spread out your wings, so you can fly
But without I...

**Chorus**
We all know you have to go
We're not alike and now it shows
This was your home, but you've outgrown
The realm we can't provide

**[Verse 2]**
Something's near, it's closing in
Power that we fear, is underneath our skin, we're wearing thin
Travel off, you will find
Every tool to be the hero of our time
Just look inside...
```
