#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
A new world awaits for you
Through night and day, it's yours to save
Trek mountains, land and sea
From Kokiri to your destiny

**Pre-Chorus**
In you I know we'll find
The hero of our time
An evil king has come to reign

**Chorus**
All that you know you'll be leaving it behind
Look deep inside, soon enough you'll find
The courage to win, now you'd best be on your way
For you have a demon to slay!

**Verse 2**
More trials await for you
It's all at stake to test your strength
Seven years you will sleep, awake and defeat
The man with the evil eyes!

**Bridge**
Time and again
Your timeline will mend
The balance returns in the end
The sun will eventually set

```
