#### Lyrics
**Intro**
We tread the same waves, and we've burned the same page
But the fire beneath our feet, it won't burn half as bright as me
Now this is my turn, it's time to make you burn
You can run and you can hide
But you can't stop the flames inside

**Chorus**
Cloaked head to toe in red
It seems you've adjusted
Coming down like a megaton
It's keeping me grounded

**Post-Chorus**
(It's keeping me grounded)

**Verse 2**
And now the flames burn brighter, and these nights grow longer
A bolero, our power will only get stronger
So try as you may, you're watching the ending of days
Right before your eyes

**Verse 3**
Can't run, you're chasing after me
Look down, you'd better watch your feet
It's my domain and I'm not taking any names, taking any names
Now watch your whole world go down in flames

**Bridge**
We tread the same waves, and we've burned the same page
But the fire beneath our feet, it won't burn half as bright as me
Now this is my turn, it's time to make you burn
You can run and you can hide
But you can't stop the flames inside
```
