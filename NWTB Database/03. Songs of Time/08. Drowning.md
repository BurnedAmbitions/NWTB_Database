#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Let it all flow out
Like a river running
You cannot deny this
That your kingdom's falling again
It never ends

**Chorus**
You gotta see your life will end in shambles
You learn to breathe, but you can't see you're drowning
We rise and fall into a different level
Let your life drain out
You're fighting back, don't know what you've been thinking
A walking burden, can't you see you're sinking?
Hiding in shadows; can you fight your demons?
Can you face yourself?

**Verse 2**
You rise and fall
Like a current about to end
You could end it all
But then what's left now to defend?
It never ends

**Bridge**
I know you think that our new king isn't fair
Leaves you gasping for air
Breathe in all this despair
This ocean of hate
```
