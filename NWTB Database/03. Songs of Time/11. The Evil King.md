#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
The same old boy
From the same old house
My, how much you've grown
Such a shame you'll die alone
It's been so long
But the time has come
If only I knew
I should have known it would be you

**Pre-Chorus**
Now I don't mean to alarm you
But these toys are far too much for you
Now I aim to take what is mine
And now there's only one thing left to do now

**Chorus**
It resonates, I'll take it all
You're just in time to see the fall
You heed the ever-sounding call
Now you've lost it all
Called you the hero of our time
You're just a thief, took what is mine
Our fates were always intertwined
And soon you'll find that I will be your king

**Verse 2**
I was young, but I had always known
A barren desert that I roam
You could never understand
How it feels to be alone
But I was meant to rule this world
You'd best say goodbye
And now you're standing in my way
And now I need my, I need my room to fly

**Bridge**
You will see true suffering
Together we make three
So you're always stuck with me
My hate will cycle
And will soon be born anew

**Outro**
And soon enough
My praises you will-
I will be your (King)
You'll never be my king!
