#### Lyrics
**Intro**
Oh, sweet child, it's so nice to finally meet you
Now welcome to your home
Safe and sound, underground, they'll never reach you
And you'll never be alone

**Verse 1**
We'll live a life, just you and I
Now settle down, have a slice of pie
I'll stay here by your side
I only wish to see you smile
You're such an interesting child
Now there's no need to fight

**Pre-Chorus**
Just promise me that you'll never leave

**Chorus**
Oh, sweet child, it's so nice to finally meet you
Now welcome to your home
Safe and sound, underground, they'll never reach you
And you'll never be alone

**Verse 2**
My only wish is just to reach you
So many snail facts I could teach you
Stop asking me to leave
Don't run away, just stay inside
Don't live a life of genocide
Can't you just stay with me?

**Pre-Chorus**
Just promise me that you'll never leave
Why can't you see this life was meant to be now?

**Outro**
You look so much like someone I used to care for
But now they've gone away
A life of darkness is bound to try and tempt you
So promise you won't stray
Please promise me
```
