#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Day and night my mind is running
Reaching out 'cause I want something more
That I've never had before
I'm scared to chase what I've been dreaming
Beyond a want and now I need it
Push me by surprise
So I can take the dive

**Verse 2**
Day and night my mind is racing
Dents and foot prints I've been pacing
What am I supposed to find?
My god, I'm the bait and the predator's my mind
It eats at me all the time (Eats at me)
Can we stop and rewind? (Can we stop and rewind?)
I'm not so sure

**Chorus**
When'd I become my own enemy?
I don't understand what you see in me
'Cause I'm just another story
(That's not worth a reading)
Now you've got me pinned up against the wall
Why aren't you afraid that I'll take a fall?
There's more that came before me
(Am I worth believing?)
I'm not so sure

**Verse 3**
Eye to eye our worlds collided
Ear to ear you kept me smiling
Kept me happy, kept me grounded
Before I flew away
I felt it breaking, then you came around
In this world of white noise, you're my favorite sound

**Bridge**
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
We brave and broken fewer
Three cheers to fear the future
We brave and broken fewer
Three cheers to fear the future
