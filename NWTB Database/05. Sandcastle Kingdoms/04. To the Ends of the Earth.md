#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
The saturation fades and turns to gray
It's overcast with envy
Hands are reaching, pulling me away
And yet I'm still ascending

**Pre-Chorus**
And I still, I still believe it
I feel it giving beneath my weight
My day, my way will surface and see the sun

**Chorus**
So follow me to the ends of the earth
Now take a minute and revel in it
And see how much you're worth
I'll fight and defend
I'll see this out 'til the end
So follow me (Follow me)
To the ends of the earth

**Verse 2**
Breaking down the walls, my lights and doors
I'm making room for something
Stacking up the pieces one by one
I'll build it out of nothing

**Pre-Chorus**
And I still, I still believe it
I feel it giving beneath my weight
But I'll survive the fight, so stay by my side

**Bridge**
We'll own the night
And the sun will still rise
The rain starts to cease
And I can see clearly
So follow me to the ends of the earth
Now take a minute and revel in it
And see how much you're worth
