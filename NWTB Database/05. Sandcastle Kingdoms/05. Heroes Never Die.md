#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Pull out the stops, I got a way that we can get it
Just say the word, I'll kick it up to eleven
We're knocking on your door, with what we got in store
Don't break it up, break it down (Yeah, come on!)

**Chorus**
We'll kill the night and we'll never see the sun
(Every day and night going crazy)
And I'll call the shots, don't you tell me when I'm done
(Live it up, this life is amazing)
Hey diddle-diddle, won't you meet me in the middle?
Let the music make you fly
Don't need to show no mercy 'cause heroes never die

**Verse 2**
Now listen up I'm gonna give you a rundown
Got you in my sights, you know I've got this on lockdown
We're running out and free
This life was meant for me
Step to the plate, you gotta show me what you got
Show me what you got
```
