#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
And it's so typical of me to be so cynical of you
I just keep running 'round in circles, babe
And yet I haven't found a clue
A way to get around you, no

**Pre-Chorus**
And I don't know why
But I'm mesmerized by your broken eyes, ooh
(By your broken eyes)
But I can't complain
When I go insane as I call your name
(As I call your name)

**Chorus**
And all I see is you next to me
A ghost of you tangled up in my sheets
It weighs me down to this ocean floor
I know I'll drown yet I'm begging for more

**Verse 2**
I could feel you move and hear you breathe
I could wear this heart out on my sleeve
You could break my bones and watch me bleed
I would do it all again
I could hear it in the way you speak
That you're reaching out as much as me
That you're searching for your way out
And you're dying just to live

**Pre-Chorus**
And I don't know why
But I'm mesmerized by your broken eyes, ooh
(By your broken eyes)
We've got this road and we both know where it's bound to go
(Where it's bound to go)*

**[Bridge]**
I don't know why, oh
But I'm mesmerized
I can't complain

I hear them breathe, we hear you scream [[06. This is the End]]
Branded with dollar-sign shaped scars We're in a special kind of hell [[01. Branded]]
