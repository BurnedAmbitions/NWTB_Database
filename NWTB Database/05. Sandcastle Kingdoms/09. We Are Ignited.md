#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
She found a way out of this place
It's a permanent escape
She'll stay content and save it for a rainy day
And all the while you had your say
Didn't know how to convey
You ventured off, no turning back, you've gone astray

**Chorus**
Don't look before you take the fall
Who knows when you could lose it all
The medications, new sensations have left you out in the cold
You pray and hope for better days
You're just a kid who lost their own way
Forget the enemies you've made
You're not a shadow, you won't fade

**Verse 2**
He found an open door inside
But the journey isn't right
The room's too small to spread his wings out and take flight
You've got to stand and defend
They'll push but you can never bend
And that's all logic, don't need luck to see the end

**Bridge**
Write it out in the right time
You've gotta get in your own mind
Pick it up and live it up
You got a shot so don't be a fool
I see you're doubting, but you're out, don't give it up
Now you know I'm talking to you
Ignite the spark, illuminate the dark and light your way
And carry on
