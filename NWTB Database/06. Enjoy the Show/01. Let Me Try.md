#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
You and I, we both know well
I couldn't do this by myself
And every day it's all the same
You picked me up when down I fell
But I'm still standing through and through
I know exactly what to do
I'll give it everything I got
Although I'm not stronger than you

**Pre-Chorus**
But I'll be your shield, I can be your lion
I'll dry your eyes if I see you cryin'
Believe in me
And I won't let you down

**Chorus**
But now we've come so far
I know just who we are
And we shine brighter than any gem
Between us and the sun
Now it's just you and me
Like it was meant to be
And I'll protect you, I'll defend you
If you let me try
We'll stay together, now and forever
Just let me try

**[Verse 2]**
You and I, yeah we both know
We couldn't do this on our own
You say you're fighting for my mother
But won't see how much I've grown
But I can't believe everything that I'm told
I'll fight 'til the end while I'm young and when I'm old

**Bridge**
Stay with me, fight with me
Victory's abound
Now we've got this, you can't stop us
And I won't let you down
I know you never asked to be made
