#### Lyrics
**Intro: NateWantsToBattle, Jacksepticeye**
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls
Gather 'round, gather 'round
Sit back, relax and please, stay in your seats
Kick your feet up and grab some popcorn
Oh, and of course
Oh-ho-ho, lest we not forget
Enjoy the show

**Verse 1: NateWantsToBattle**
Come one, come all and behold, we have a sight
Immeasurable, a spectacle of innocence and fright
Oh, maybe two, three, four or even five long nights
Now you're crawling, ever stalling with no end in sight
Up all night to see if you can make it
All new friends to see if you can take it
Be still, be quiet
They still know you haven't left yet

**Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
And we'll pretend, we'll just pretend
Pretend that day would never end
I'll make believe that you can see
Everything they did to me
Nowhere to hide and now we're through
But if we were just like you
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend
You can trust me 'til the end

**Verse 2: NateWantsToBattle**
There's something bad inside me
I'm broken beyond fixing, save me
I know that we've all been here
It only hurts a second, there's nothing to fear
I have you hidden way too well
It's time to let you out
Put on a mask to hide yourself
That made you one of us now

**[Bridge: NateWantsToBattle]**
We need you so we can escape
If they find you, it'll be too late
We need you so we can escape
If they find you, it'll be too late


**[Outro: NateWantsToBattle]**
Now we're afraid, we're all afraid
Afraid that it might be too late
They never learn to wait their turn
Now we get to watch them burn (Get to watch them burn)
Nowhere to hide and now we're through
But if we were just like you
I'll be your friend, I'll be your friend
You can trust me 'til the end
Trust me 'til the end
