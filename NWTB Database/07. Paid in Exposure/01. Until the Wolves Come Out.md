#### Lyrics
**Intro**
Sing it out loud until your lungs give out, yeah
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out
Sing it out loud until your lungs give out, yeah
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out

**Verse 1**
I think I broke down with both of my hands
Castles built up from watered down sand
Sing oh-whoa-whoa
Gotta sing it out loud until my lungs give out
True the rival's a voice in my head
Tell me pack up and leave it for dead
Sing oh-whoa-whoa
I gotta scream it out loud until the wolves come out
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out

**Chorus**
Now why wait for tomorrow
For mistakes that we could make tonight?
Sing it out loud until your lungs give out
Now why safely end the sorrow
When I don't wanna make things right?
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out

**Verse 2**
Broken mirrors, and what do I see?
A man with no face, he's looking at me
I know I got a million scars, wear 'em all on my sleeve
Mended hearts, but they're breaking down souls
Hit the gas but with nowhere to go, no
I got a million problems, you know they're all me
A million problems, you know they're all me

**Bridge**
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out, yeah
Sing it out loud until your lungs, no

**Interlude, spoken: Music video exclusive**
We're out here chasing dreams and making memes, you know I'm fuckin'- yeet!

***Chorus**
Sing it out loud until your lungs give out
Now why safely end the sorrow
When I don't wanna make things right?
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out*

**Outro**
Now why wait for tomorrow
For mistakes that we could make tonight?
Sing it out loud until your lungs give out
Now why safely end the sorrow
When I don't wanna make things right?
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out
Scream it out loud until the wolves come out

Now with my own hands, built castles from sand, But all kingdoms drown as tides bring them down [[10. Sandcastle Kingdoms]]

This can't be real, it's in my head, Give it up, you're better off dead [[06. This is the End]]

Made my mirror show someone I don't know [[10. Sandcastle Kingdoms]]
The mirror shows somebody else [[01. Branded]]

Branded with dollar-sign shaped scars [[01. Branded]]
