#### Lyrics
**Intro Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
You're smoke and guns
You think I'm sick of it?
I wouldn't have it any other way
You're too much fun
Think I can't handle it?
Left with no words and yet so much to say

**Verse 1: NateWantsToBattle**
Now in my darkest hour and not my brightest day
I find I'm calling you and telling you "I should not say"
I'm melting in your hands, go on, make your demands
You've got me slipping through your fingers like I'm made of sand

**Pre-Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
When we hit the lights, you're fading out of sight
I feel your heartbeat, wrap yourself around me
Is it all for show? Because I'm good to go
So go ahead, I'll take it all

**Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
You're smoke and guns
You think I'm sick of it?
I wouldn't have it any other way
You're too much fun
Think I can't handle it?
Left with no words and yet so much to say
You wanted from me, some honesty
So honestly, I wanna feel you breathe
You're smoke and guns
You think I'm sick of it?
I wouldn't have it any other way

**Verse 2: NateWantsToBatle**
Now, as your lipstick smears
By light of chandelier
I taste the tension and I'm begging "Don't you disappear"
Not in my rightest mind, you tell me, "That's just fine"
Oh what an evening, now you're leaving
With my hands still tied

**Pre-Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
When we hit the lights, you're fading out of sight
I feel your heartbeat, wrap yourself around me
Is it all for show? Because I'm good to go
So go ahead, I'll take it all

Now with my own hands, built castles from sand [[10. Sandcastle Kingdoms]]
I think I broke down with both of my hands Castles built up from watered down sand [[01. Until the Wolves Come Out]]]

Only shadows we're meant to fade [[06. Hold On to You]]

I said come one, come all, enjoy the show, Three to get ready, nowhere to go [[06. Blood and Ink]]
