#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Hey, I'm sick of feeling I'm sinking
I'm getting so sick of thinking
'Cause it just makes me wanna stop
Wait, can't figure out what I'm missing
And I forgot how to listen
To the things that I really want

**Pre-Chorus**
I feel so small that I got it all, what I can't afford
The way's unlocked, but I'm too tired to open the door

**Chorus**
Oh, and now my life is
All up, for everyone to break down
And think they've got it figured out
Oh, my doors are locked up
No one is getting in
Until I open up and call it off
I can't open up and call it off

**Verse 2**
Hey, I'm sick of dealing with people
And yet I know I'm their equal
No, I'm no better than anyone else
Hide, I wish that no one can see me
Yeah, maybe life will be easy
If I learned how to let it go

**Bridge**
A cry for help, that's what you're thinking or you're wishing
Well maybe I just wanna vent
Don't break it down, just let it be what it will be
Just let me be a little discontent

And I'm losing it, so sick of it
The door's open but I built up a wall [[07. Sleight of Hand]]
