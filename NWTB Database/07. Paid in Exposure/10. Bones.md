#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Can you believe in something that you can’t even see?
Can you agree we’re part of something bigger than you and me?

**Pre-Chorus**
I'll take the long road home that’s lined with blood and snow
Now I've become so numb that I can’t even feel the cold

**Chorus**
(Oh!) And you can give and take
Crack my bones but my heart won’t break now
(Oh!) And don't commit no crime
Find me innocent but still I serve my time

**Verse 2**
I think I believe, now I can feel it speaking to me
My reasoning is logical like it’s all in my dreams

**Pre-Chorus**
I'll take the long road home that’s lined with blood and snow
Am I forever young or will I simply fade before I’m old?

**Bridge**
Crack my bones but my heart won't break now
And don't commit no crime
Find me innocent but still I serve my time
(Ha-ah-ah!) The mirror's always showing me
(Ha-ah-ah!) A shell of who I used to be

**Pre-Chorus**
I'll take the long road home that’s lined with blood and snow
I've become so numb that I can’t even feel the cold
I'll take the long road home that’s lined with blood and snow
Am I forever young, or will I simply fade before I’m old?*

**Outro**
Would you never die if you lived a life
Frozen and empty?
What you fighting for when you start a war?
And you're your own worst enemy?

**Pre-Chorus**
We've got this road and we both know where it's bound to go [[08. All I See]]
The medications, new sensations have left you out in the cold [[09. We Are Ignited]]

**Chorus**
.
I could wear this heart out on my sleeve, You could break my bones and watch me bleed [[08. All I See]]
.

**Verse 2**
I'm scared to chase what I've been dreaming, Beyond a want and now I need it [[02. StopRewind]]

**Pre-Chorus**
You're just a kid who lost their own way, Forget the enemies you've made
You're not a shadow, you won't fade [[09. We Are Ignited]]

The mirror shows somebody else [[01. Branded]]
To a shell that's hollowed out, Before I knew I became one of them [[06. Paid in Exposure]]
