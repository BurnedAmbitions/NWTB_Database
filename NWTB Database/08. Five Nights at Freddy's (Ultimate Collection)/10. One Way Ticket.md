#### Lyrics
**Intro**
'Cause you and I
We got a one way ticket to Hell

**Verse 1**
Now time and time again
I swear I'm done
But you created this monster
So now let's have some fun
Let's drive ourselves insane
Just tryna find the truth
A nightmare we won't wake up from
All thanks to you

**Chorus**
All I see is an empty room
So play your cards just right
And this will be your tomb
Now this fire has ignited
Now you'll burn as well
'Cause you and I
We got a one way ticket to Hell
'Cause you and I
We got a one way ticket to Hell

**Verse 2**
I'm a reflection
I'll show this mess you made
It never dies (Neither will I)
No, there's no stopping me
You put me down
Now I've made my bed
And I'll never leave
I'll never let you rest
```

I got a one way ticket straight out of here
And I don't know where it goes [[04. Take me Anywhere]]
**Verse 1**
I know I swore that this was the last time [[09. Madness]]

But this will all end soon /I'm your nightmare [[06. This is the End]]
