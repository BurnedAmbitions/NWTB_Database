#### Lyrics
**Intro: NateWantsToBattle**
(Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? I...)

**Verse 1: NateWantsToBattle**
Can you hear me? I, I've been calling to you
Don't fall astray, I can show you what I'm hiding
And I can tell you anything you wanna know
I could take you right to where you wanna go
Hide yourself behind a mask even though you're so reluctant

**Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
Father of children without a home
Creator of vessels without a soul
Just stay the course, focus on my voice
I'll show you the way then you'll rejoice

**Verse 2: CG5**
Can you hear me? I, I've been following you
You wear a mask but I know what you've been hiding
I wanna give it all but I don't wanna know
I follow you but I don't really wanna go
I heard you loud and clear, and there ain't no miscommunication

**Chorus: CG5**
Father of children without a home
Creator of vessels without a soul
I'll stay the course, I will follow you
Show me the way, I'll be there soon

**Bridge: CG5, NateWantsToBattle, Both**
I'm back, revamped, the madness never ends
It's not over yet, there's nothing left to mend
It's all I have, no, nothing else can stay
It's all you want, you don't want me to change
I'm back, revamped, the madness never ends
It's not over yet, there's nothing left to mend
It's all I have, no, nothing else can stay
It's all you want, you don't want me to change

**Verse 2: CG5**

Wear a mask to hide yourself / When really it makes us the same [[02. Mangled]]
You dream to one day become that star / The journey's do or die /But you're not willing to go that far [[07. I'd Love to Break It to You]]
