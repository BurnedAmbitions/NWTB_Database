#### Lyrics
**Intro**
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game

**Verse 1**
Am I insane? Chasing demons in my brain
Are they to blame or are they victims from another save?
I might've made, I might've made a grave mistake
It's not okay, I'm using up the time you gained

**Pre-Chorus**
Head keeps spinning like a windmill
.
Give up on getting out, no, I never will
.
Memories replay, making me ill
.
Caught you red-handed from the blood spilt
Remember my name, every replay until you find my grave
Remember my name, I'm gonna take this to the grave

**Chorus**
Am I another rotation, another iteration?
Ain't no taking back your crimes
In a coffin of brick, now it's making me sick
Now I gotta serve out your time
Play me out like a fool, use her up like a tool
Your sins you can't erase
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game

**Post-Chorus**
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a game
I'm not insane, I'm just another ghost inside a

**Verse 2**
Am I insane? Thinking you could change
Haunted and unwanted until I've been tossed away
Am I insane? I know we're all deranged
This machine is too obscene and I can't let it fade away

**Verse 1**
In the back of my mind, I've been trying to chase a monster this whole time [[08. Nightmare]]
It's not a game, not to blame, we're forced to hide [[08. Nightmare]]
Finding me was your worst mistake [[05. Salvaged]]

**Pre-Chorus**
Tricks and traps leave your head spinning [[06. Twisted]] 
Why can't I get out? Why am I still here? [[09. Madness]]
It's underneath my skin / These god forsaken memories [[04. Take me Anywhere]]
These halls are lined with blood I can't have on my hands [[07. No More]]
To the grave we only take our name [[10. Sandcastle Kingdoms]]
.

**Chorus**
My hate will cycle / And will soon be born anew [[11. The Evil King]]
All the taunts and the tricks/ yeah, they're making me sick [[02. Let Me In]]
(Oh!) And don't commit no crime, Find me innocent but still I serve my time [[10. Bones]]
Relinquish me from all my sins [[02. Let Me In]]
