#### Lyrics
**Intro: NateWantsToBattle**
I've done my part, I stayed on time
I've got my alibis, got no reason to lie
Stay out of mind and out of sight
Now who turned out the lights?
My chest is getting tight

**Verse 1: NateWantsToBattle**
Nothing but a single bone
Walking through the halls alone
Telling me that my cover's blown
That's the saddest tactic
Cut the wires, oxygen is getting low
Hit the vents, chopping heads in a single blow
You know the truth, it doesn't matter, now you're just a ghost
To my satisfaction

**Chorus: NateWantsToBattle**
I've done my part, I stayed on time
I've got my alibis, got no reason to lie
Stay out of mind and out of sight
Now who turned out the lights?
My chest is getting tight
I'm struggling with what you see
I'm on my hands and knees
I swear it isn't me, your accusation's a disgrace
So say it to my face, I'll send you into space

**Verse 2: AmaLee with NateWantsToBattle**
You call me up, call me out, say I'm not around
You point the blame, throw my name, you don't make a sound
I can see your deceit, now you're going down
All the pieces you've been leaving, look what I have found
Kinda sus', kinda sus', kinda sus'
Now you got me thinking that you're one of us
Kinda sus', kinda sus', kinda sus'
Apologies, I'm throwing you under the bus

**Verse 3: CG5**
Don't send me into space, no
Listen to me, won't you get out of my face, though?
I know nothing 'bout the body in the 'Bay, no
I was swiping up in Admin, for what felt like an eternity
Don't you put the blame on me
All my friends being thrown out, man, it kills me
Don't think for a minute that I'm in it for the thrills, it wasn't me
So why don't you show yourself and leave us be
