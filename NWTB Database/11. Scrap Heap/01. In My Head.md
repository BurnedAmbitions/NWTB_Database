**Intro**
Get it

**Verse 1**
Yeah, I been locked down
Kept tucked away but now I'm breaking out (Out)

The voice in my head says I can't trust you now (Woo!)

**Pre-Chorus**
You don't know the half of it (Half of it)
Hands up while I take the hits (Take the hits)
It's something that you can't admit
I fight for my life, now I'm done with your sh-

**Chorus**
Say it once, say it twice, now you're in my head
Say it all a thousand times, leaving me for dead
Say it once, say it twice, now you're in my head
Say it at the same time, Jinx, and now you're dead
Say it once, say it twice, now you're in my head
Say it all a thousand times, leaving me for dead
Say it once, say it twice, now you're in my head
Say it at the same time, Jinx, and now you're dead

**Verse 2**
Now I'm all out of options (Options)
Don't you try to reason, ain't nobody that can stop this
Yeah, you pushed me to progress (Progress)
No turning back now gonna show you who's the strongest (Woo!)
