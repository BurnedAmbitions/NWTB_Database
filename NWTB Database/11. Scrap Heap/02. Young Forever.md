#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Ignoring all the signs to turn ourselves around
To stay alive and hide the secrets that I have found
We came but no one ever left or made a sound
You tried to lock me up but I've found my way out

**Chorus**
Our innovation is the key
(It's yours and it's now or never)
So let go and you'll finally be free
(We're gonna stay young forever)
Young forever

**Verse 2**
Rip my voice from inside of me (Ready to go)
Don't wanna see the bloody side of me (Letting it show)
I bet you didn't know that I could bleed (You and me both)
Death ain't forever, it's temporary

**Bridge**
Turning down all the warning signs
Give it all up to live my life
So wake up soon and you will find
You're not alive until you're ready to die

You can't take me anywhere / I got a way back home and an open door [[04. Take me Anywhere]]

Am I forever young or will I simply fade before Iâ€™m old? [[10. Bones]]

**Verse 2**

The blood spilt into deep pools of evidence / Take a stab and see me bleed for the hell of it [[03. To My Grave]]

**Bridge**
There's so many warnings that I've been ignoring / Now it's shutting down [[04. Take me Anywhere]]
Was it out of love or out of fear?/ If you ask me, I don't know/ You forget how to want once you've had it all [[04. Take me Anywhere]]
