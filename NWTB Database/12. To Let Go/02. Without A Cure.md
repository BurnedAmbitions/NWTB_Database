#### Lyrics
**[Intro]**
Every day, it's the same shit
You're a drug that I can't quit
I give it my all, then I hit a wall, and there you are
No leads and I'm in a maze, I'm weak, you don't wanna change
With every day, I'm sick of your name

**[Chorus]**
You're in my brain, we walk same planes
Stuck here together (Here together)
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
You share my name, for worse or for better
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself

**[Post-Chorus]**
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
(Myself)

**[Verse]**
You say you wanna make it right
Every day, it's another fight
The memories hurt
They flow through my blood without a cure
You're a curse and you're all mine
I can feel you all the time
I've been through it all and you've seen it too, it's me and you

**[Chorus]**
We walk same planes
Stuck here together (Here together)
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
You share my name, for worse or for better
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself

**[Post-Chorus]**
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
(Myself)

**[Bridge]**
Don't come crawling back to me again
You know I'm a sucker for your mess

**[Chorus]**
We walk same planes
Stuck here together (Here together)
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
You share my name, for worse or for better
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
(Don't come crawling back to me again)
We walk same planes
Stuck here together (Here together)
(You know I'm a sucker for your mess)
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself
(Don't come crawling back to me again)
You share my name, for worse or for better
(You know I'm a sucker for your mess)
Maybe I'll just break it off with myself

***[Outro]**
Don't come crawling back to me again
You know I'm a sucker for your mess
Don't come crawling back to me again
You know I'm a sucker for your mess*
