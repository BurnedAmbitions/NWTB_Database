#### Lyrics
**[Verse 1]**
Is it do or die? Because one sounds faster
I live in shadows of strangers, or maybe they're all mine
Now they all blend together, is this my fear or my anger?
(My anger?)

**[Pre-Chorus]**
But I can't keep, keep on hoping this will fix itself
(Hoping this will fix itself)
And I can't speak for all your secrets I could never tell

**[Chorus]**
Don't wanna live your lie, just wanna live my life
But I can't, 'cause I know that you might never change
Just wanna live some truth that wasn't changed by you
What I'd give just to know that you'll forget my name
Left your mark on me, and it's onе that I can't show
I won't keep crawling 'round in circles

**[Verse 2]**
Alone in my own mind
Wherе my world's losing power, and every voice getting louder
Is this the rest of time?
Every day's getting longer, am I supposed to get stronger?
(Stronger?)

**[Pre-Chorus]**
And I can't keep, keep on hoping that you'll find some help
(Hoping that you'll find some help)
And I can't buy into stories that you try to sell

**[Chorus]**
Don't wanna live your lie, just wanna live my life
But I can't, 'cause I know that you might never change
Just wanna live some truth that wasn't changed by you
What I'd give just to know that you'll forget my name
Left your mark on me, and it's one that I can't show
I won't keep crawling 'round in circles
```
