#### Lyrics
**[Verse 1]**
I'm livin’ in silence, I've learned to dismantle all my pride
The feelings are violent, Heaven and Hell both know I tried
Yeah, you lit the match to all that we had
But it's my choice to watch it burn
Now it’s all the same and you're all to blame
But it's on me that this still hurts

**[Chorus]**
And I finally think I found some hope
And I'm not afraid, afraid to let you go
You were the part of me that died
But I never mourned you, I never cried
So live how you will, I hope that it helps you cope

**[Verse 2]**
I'm learning to griеve now, lamenting a family still alive
My wounds arе still open, you forced me to learn to say goodbye
Are you leaving soon? The ghost in my room
But I'm the one unfulfilled
A curse in my head, you left me for dead
A phantom that haunts me still
.

**[Chorus]**
And I finally think I found some hope
And I'm not afraid, afraid to let you go
You were the part of me that died
But I never mourned you, I never cried
So live how you will, I hope that it helps you cope (Woo!)

**[Breakdown]**
Begone, begone dammit
Begone, because I never said I'd wait now
Begone, begone dammit
Begone, because I never said I’d wait for you

**[Chorus]**
And I finally think I found some hope
(I think I finally found some hope)
And I’m not afraid, afraid to let you go
You were the part of me that died
But I never mourned you, I never cried
So live how you will, I hope that it helps you cope
