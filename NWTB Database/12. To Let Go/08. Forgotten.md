#### Lyrics
**[Verse 1]**
Said it's fight or flight, here I am just standin' still (Here I am just standin' still)
Said it's make or break like I'm chasin' after thrills (Chasin' after thrills)
Said to call me when you need, now I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
Holdin' on to every word I heard you say (Word I heard you say)

**[Pre-Chorus]**
The pages keep turnin'
.
The fires in our hearts keep burnin'
.
We're soldiers who don't go down without a fight

**[Chorus]**
We won't be forgotten
Give it all you've got again and again
So you got knocked down, I know you're not out
Hold your ground and take your stand
'Cause you won't be forgotten, no, not again

**[Post-Chorus]**
Not again

**[Verse 2]**
Livin' in these shadows, I'm still chasin' lights
'Cause you're bound to lose every battle you don't fight
Gotta keep on runnin' еven when therе ain't no end in sight
When the story's over, it stays with me 'til the end of time

**[Chorus]**
We won't be forgotten
Give it all you've got again and again
So you got knocked down, I know you're not out
Hold your ground and take your stand
'Cause you won't be forgotten, no, not again

**[Post-Chorus]**
No, not again

**[Bridge]**
All the gravity could never hold us down
And we'll go so far with the fire that we found
All the pain and the love keeps my heart full
You and I, we're undefeatable
Spread your wings and never let your flame go out

**[Pre-Chorus]**
(We won't be forgotten)
(Give it all you've got again and again)

**[Chorus]**
So you got knocked down, I know you're not out
Hold your ground and take your stand
'Cause you won't be forgotten
We won't be forgotten
Give it all you've got again and again
So you got knocked down, I know you're not out
Hold your ground and take your stand
'Cause you won't be forgotten
No, not again
