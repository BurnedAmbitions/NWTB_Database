#### Lyrics
**[Intro]**
(I'll take the assault, say it's my fault)
(Long as I can let them win)
(Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up)
(Fictional kind of sin)
(I'll take the assault, say it's my fault)
(Long as I can let them win)
(Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up)
(Fictional kind of sin)

**[Verse 1]**
It looks like I'm a spiral once again
How does it always find a way?
I'll embrace every demon, invite them in
Why do I always let them stay?

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Can't help but feel like I'm manic
Can you hear me through the static?
Why can't I just recall, yeah
Recall back when I had a purpose
When I wasn't always so nervous
When I wasn't up against a wall

**[Chorus]**
I'll take the assault, say it's my fault
Long as I can let them win
Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up
Fictional kind of sin
When evеry day is another day
Another day I can feel the rain
Can't wait to watch mysеlf cavin' in

**[Post-Chorus]**
(I'll take the assault, say it's my fault)
(Long as I can let them win)
(Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up)
(Fictional kind of sin)

**[Verse 2]**
I can feel something vile under my skin
I think I'm gonna watch it crawl (I'ma watch it crawl)
All in stride, with a smile I'm wearing thin
What am I underneath it all?

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Can't help but feel like I'm manic
Can you hear me through the static?
Why can't I just recall, yeah
Recall back when I had a purpose
When I wasn't always so nervous
When I wasn't up against a wall

**[Chorus]**
I'll take the assault, say it's my fault
Long as I can let them win
Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up
Fictional kind of sin
Countin' from five, lost in the love
Still try to find my worth
All of it stacks, pushin' me back
To who I left in the dirt
I'll take the assault, say it's my fault
Long as I can let them win (Long as I can let them win)
Wait 'til I'm down, push myself up
Fictional kind of sin (Fictional kind of sin)
When every day is another day (Another day)
Another day I can feel the rain (Feel the rain)
Can’t wait to watch myself cavin' in
