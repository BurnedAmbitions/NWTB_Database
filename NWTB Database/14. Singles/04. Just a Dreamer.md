#### Lyrics
**Verse 1**
Now I know we've seen better days
But do we have control, or is it all the same?
No, we all want a better ending
We're more than where we're from
This journey isn't done

**Pre-Chorus**
No one can be everything they want (-thing they want)
Daydream and escape to another world
A whole new story now has begun (Has begun)
You're more than what you do
Why's it defining you? (-fining you)

**Chorus**
(Hey!) I can see just what it is you need
A land of make believe
Where it's just you and me (You and me)
(Hey!) Now you play it out all in your mind
(Hey!) We can hide away until the end of time
(Hey!) I can see just what it is you need
A land of make believe
Where you and me can run and dream (Run and dream)
Where you and me can run and dream (Dream)

**Verse 2**
Now I'm only a dreamer, I'm just like you
But if you're a believer, you can join me too
Hands shaking now, I can't let go
My throat, it tightens up
I say enough's enough

**Pre-Chorus**
No one can be everything they want (-thing they want)
Daydream and escape to another world
A whole new story now has begun (Has begun)
Go on and take your stand
Decision's in your hand


**Bridge**
Been waiting out such a long time, yeah
Let's make a future where you and I
See the light that's inside
Now I feel the light start to run low
And if it fades, you and I both know
That the shadows come and grow
