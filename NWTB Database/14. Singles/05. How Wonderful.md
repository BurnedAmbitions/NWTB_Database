#### Lyrics
**Intro**
You know that I can feel it flowing through my bones
And now we're all on the verge of connection
'Cause you and I, now we've waited for so long
And this'll be-

**Verse 1**
I've been working oh so hard
I was hoping I'd find you (I'd find you)
I've got a small favor to ask
It's something you can do (You can do)
It's far from reach and incomplete
But it's shiny and brand new (And brand new)
And then in time, we'll connect the lines
For a future with you

**Pre-Chorus**
And now it's finally free

**Chorus**
You know that I can feel it flowing through my bones
And now we're all on the verge of connection (Oh)
'Cause you and I, now we've waited for so long
And this'll be our greatest creation (Oh)
Now the game we made and the words we sing
You'll find them very, very interesting
How wonderful to hear that you've been looking for me too

**Verse 2**
Dark and darker, still
The shadows cut so deep (Cut so deep)
With everything we've come to learn
Tell me what you think? (What you think?)
I got something up my sleeve
I heard that you've been looking for me
Well, here I am, do what you will
It's not at all what you were expecting

**[Pre-Chorus]**
It's all just for me


**Outro**
Take this as you will, heart is beating still
Why, why can't you see, that this was all for me?
Take this as you will, heart is beating still
Why, why can't you see, that this was all for me?
```
