#### Lyrics
**Intro**
Right then!
Now, why don't you and I get down to the nitty-gritty?
And then we can let the fun begin

**Verse 1**
Radio Demon, it's a pleasure
Sign it twice just for better measure
A good investment, but bad intentions
A clause or two I forgot to mention
Now please excuse my sudden interest
Saw your fiasco and had to visit
I can offer you my service
Don't you worry, the price is worth it now

**Chorus**
Now if you'd take a look around
Then you could see the sights and all the sounds
Of your world on fire
So sign the line, you'll be fine
Hell, you'll be all mine
An R.O.I. on the day you die

**Verse 2**
I can pull from my resources
Take what you want and stay remorseless
A little dusting, a lot of dealing
I'll make this hotel so appealing (Yes, I will!)
And I'm calling in as many favors you want
But when it's all said and done
Your soul is mine to haunt (Hahahaha...)

**Bridge**
Now with all the fine print and logistics out of the way
What do you say? Do we have a deal?
