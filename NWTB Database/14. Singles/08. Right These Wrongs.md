#### Lyrics
**Intro**
Help me help you out (I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt (Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out, you don't want help
See you in Hell

**Verse 1**
I know that you burnt out a couple times
Your life that you wasted before you died
You lived no regrets, tell 'em all you're fine, ain't it a lie?
A sorry excuse for a rotten soul
You had all your fun, time to pay the toll
And now you're down here with nowhere to go
And nobody knows

**Chorus**
Help me help you out (I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt (Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out, you don't want help
See you in Hell

**Verse 2**
Behind every lie, I can take a stance
Behind every demon's another chance
I'll be the one to give a second glance
According to plans
Broken and damned, I'ma set them straight
Their burden to bare, I can hold the weight
Sent down to burn but it ain't too late
Rewriting their fate

**Chorus**
Help me help you out (I'ma need a little more)
Sick of all your doubt (Burn me to my core)
I'm tryna bail you out, you don't want help
See you in Hell
You know I still believe (We could wash it all away)
Your sins could be redeemed (Enjoy your stay)
I'm tryna right these wrongs, it's been so long
But I'll stay strong
```
